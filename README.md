This is a toy project, written in Node.js and Javascript, to extract keywords from a repo and display it as a word cloud.
I was not totally pleased with the breakdown offered by the already made lib keyword-extractor found on npmjs, or maybe I missed some configurations.
So I approached the text split problem naively with simple regular expressions, which is not satisfactory either, unless backed by strong stopwords lists.
You may develop on this base, please fork and share !
Reference implementation seems to be in Python, like Rake.
